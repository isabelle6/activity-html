    <h1>The Simpsons</h1>
    
    <img src="images/simpsonfamily.jpg" alt="Simpson Family"> <!-- Image and description for accessibility -->
    
    <p>The main members of the family are:</p>
    <ul> <!-- Unordered list -->
        <li>Homer Simpson</li>
        <li>Marge Simpson</li>
        <li>Bart Simpson</li>
        <li>Lisa Simpson</li>
        <li>Maggie Simpson</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Homer Simpson</h2>
    <img src="images/homersimpson.jpg" alt="Homer Simpson">
    <p>Homer is the father of the Simpson family. He is an overweight, lazy, and ignorant individual, but is strongly devoted to his wife and children. Despite this and his below average intelligence, Homer has shown moments of great intelect, and can be a caring parent and husband at times. In 1960, Homer experimented to see if he could push fifteen crayons into his nose, which resulted in one being lodged into his brain and being responsible for his current below-average intelligence.</p>
    
    <h2>Marge Simpson</h2>
    <img src="images/margesimpson.jpg" alt="Marge Simpson">
    <p>Marge is the beautiful, happy housemaker and full-time mom of the Simpson family. She is the moralistic force in her family and often provides a grouding voice in the midst of her family's antics by trying to maintain order in the Simpson household. Aside from her duties at home, Marge has flirted briefly with a number of careers ranging from police officer to anti-violence activist.</p>
    
    <h2>Bart Simpson</h2>
    <img src="images/bartsimpson.jpg" alt="Bart Simpson">
    <p>Bart is the mischievous, rebellious, misunderstood and "potentially dangerous" eldest child of Homer and Marge Simpson, and the older brother of Lisa and Maggie. He is a self-proclaimed underachiever who is constantly in detention. He is easily distracted. His penchant for shocking people began before he was born: Bart "mooned" Dr. Hibbert while he performed a sonogram on Marge, and moments after being born he set fire to Homer's tie (Marge saying that he could not have done it because he was only ten minutes old). Bart's first words were "Ay Caramba".</p>
    
    <h2>Lisa Simpson</h2>
    <img src="images/lisasimpson.jpg" alt="Lisa Simpson">
    <p>Lisa is a charismatic eight-year-old girl who exceeds the standard achievement of intelligence level of children her age. Not to everyone's surprise, she is also the moral ceter of her family. In her upbringing, Lisa lacks parental involvement of Homer and Marge, which leads to hobbies such as playing saxophone and guitar, riding and caring for horses, and interest in advanced studies. In school, Lisa's popularity is affected by those who view her as a geeky overachiever, which leaves her with only a few friends. Lisa Simpson is a smart, witty, independent girl who focuses on her goals and strives to reach her potential, and at the age of eight she is already a member of MENSA with an IQ of 159.</p>
    
    <h2>Maggie Simpson</h2>
    <img src="images/maggiesimpson.jpg" alt="Maggie Simpson">
    <p>Maggie is the youngest child of Marge and Homer, and baby sister to Bart and Lisa. She is often seen sucking on her pacifier, and, when she walks, she trips over her clothing and falls on her face. Because she rarely ever talks, Maggie is the least seen and heard in the Simpson family.</p>
